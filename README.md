# Escape the Metaverse
> A combination of Passthrough, HandSDK and VoiceSDK enables users to experience a fully fledged escape room at home.


VR-Escape rooms are fun, giving users the possibility to experience various settings, with countless possibilities to interact. BUT there are always things like furniture, space, etc... which prevent players from having a truly immersive experience at home. In addition, there is no guide helping you when you're stuck and when you're close to solving a hard riddle, the controller batteries run out.

With "Escape the Metaverse" we enable players to overcome the hindrances mentioned above. Passthrough prevents players from stumbling over furniture. VoiceSDK allows them to interact with a virtual guide and gives them a Jeopardy-like experience for answering questions. Using the HandSDK, we'll reach a new level of immersion and empty batteries in controllers belong to the past.
